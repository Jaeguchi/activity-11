        <p>This is a template that is great for small businesses. It doesn't have too much fancy flare to it, but it makes a great use of the standard Bootstrap core components. Feel free to use this template for any project you want!</p>

          <p>Our goal is to help you to meet the needs of your families, organisations, Churches and ethnic groups in settings that reflect the vibrant Pasifika communities of Auckland which contribute so much colour and joy to all our lives. Our Pasifika Community Centre staff will take pleasure in understanding how we can help you have a successful gathering, meeting, celebration or for whatever purpose you come to the Centre and that you leave having had your needs met and your goals achieved. There is a variety of spaces of different sizes, each equipped with state-of-the-art IT and presentation equipment and three are able to provide video-conferencing capability. A special feature of the MIT Pasifika Community Centre is the provision of a “Faith Space” which provides a room that can be used for religious observance, reflection, meditation or simply a quiet space in a busy world. Associated with this is a fully equipped office for the use of our Faith Leaders. There is also a purpose built “Parents’ Room” where the needs of the little ones can be met in privacy.</p>
          <p>The MIT Pasifika Community Centre would be an ideal venue for conferences and meetings for any number of people up to 100 people with all the facilities you need – a large gathering room, break out rooms, all equipment and on-site catering. Groups undertaking professional development, strategic planning, team building or simply getting    together would be most welcome to use this facility, with its wonderful themed atmosphere, a special place for your important day. We look forward to welcoming you to the MIT Pasifika Community Centre – discuss your needs with the Centre staff. They will take care of you – room set-up, technical    support, security, and in-house catering – all as required. MIT is home to nearly 6,000 Pasifika students and has had thousands of Pasifika Graduates over the years. It is active through the Pacific and especially with programmes in the Kingdom of Tonga and in Samoa. We take pride in supporting the development of strong and thriving communities.</p>
